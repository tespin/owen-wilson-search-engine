# Owen Wilson Wow Search Engine

The Owen Wilson Wow Search Engine lets you search for every instance the word "Wow" is said by actor Owen Wilson. It pulls from Avi Mamenko's [Owen Wilson Wow API](https://owen-wilson-wow-api.onrender.com/). It features:

- search by movie title
- navigation through paginated results
- random 'Wows' on the home page
- testing on the API calls

The project was made with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [EJS](https://ejs.co/).
